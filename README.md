# Solar-Energy-Extraction-Optimization-using-ASHRAE-Model
 • Developed a generalized code based on the ASHRAE model to estimate solar irradiation in six different cities in India.
 • This project aimed to determine the maximum solar radiation data,facilitating optimal energy harvesting.
 • Seasonal and annual variations of solar radiation were analyzed for cities in India , optimizing the tilt angle for solar panels.
 • The research will inform and guide future solar energy projects, supporting India’s transition to a cleaner and more sustainable
   energy landscape by optimizing the use of solar energy.
 • The results help to improve the efficiency of solar energy systems by determining ideal tilt angles for different times and
   locations.
